An expect client designed to work specifically with CLI shell interfaces. Specifically, it always assumes a prompt will separate the data allowing easy traversal of multiple outputs.

### Status

It is thought to be feature complete and stable and has a comprehensive test suite, however, it has seen very limited real world use. Use at your own risk.
